Why use Sync & Collaboration Tools?
===================================

The easiest way to translate your application is to translate the
``.po`` files directly in a text editor, or with a tool like
`Poedit <https://poedit.net>`_.

This solution may be good enough when your application is still
small and doesn't evolve much, but quickly becomes a pain when the number
of sentences to translate, and target languages to manage, increases with
time.

It then becomes more and more difficult and time-consuming to manage the
back and forth with the translators, while keeping your application
``.po`` files up-to-date with the current state of a codebase that doesn't
stop evolving.

That's why sync and collaboration tools are directly integrated into Lingui
to help structure your work with your translators team, ensure the consistency
of the translations, and make your life easier.

Regular Workflow
----------------

This is the most basic workflow which involves sending the ``.po`` files to
your translators (usually by email) and syncing them back manually into your
application.

This workflow is manageable when your application is still quite small,
doesn't contain a lot of text, and doesn't evolve much.

Sync & Collaboration Tool Workflow

When the amount of text to translate increases, and the number of target
languages grows, it becomes more efficient to use a sync and
collaboration tools to assist you with the management of your team of
translators, and co-evolution between your code and the translated
files.

Instead of manually sending and receiving many emails and fixing the
inconsistencies with your code, a ``sync`` method is called and your ``.po``
and ``.js`` files are directly updated with the latest translations. Your
translators will also be warned when there are new text to translate.

Benefits of these tools
=======================

* **Synchronization**: unique ``yarn sync`` or ``npm run sync`` command to
  synchronize your project with all your translators and update your local
  ``.po`` and ``.js`` files with the latest translations.
* **Translation Interface**: provide a professional and flexible interface to
  translators.
* **Translation Memory**: assist translators by suggesting previously
  translated sentences that are similar.
* **Machine Translation**: auto-translate with Google Translate, DeepL, etc.
  and human-proofread later.
* **Smart Plural Management**: allows to translate ``Message`` and
  ``Messages`` instead of ``{count, plural, one {Message} other {Messages}}``.
* **Consistency**: assist translators with ``{variable}`` interpolation and
  HTML formatting.

Configure your project
======================

To synchronize your current application with an online tool, you just have to
add these lines at the end of your ``.linguirc`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: js

  {
    [...]
    "service": {
      "name": "ToolName",
      "apiKey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345"
    }
  }

The synchronization will then be part of the ``lingui extract`` command.


List of available tools
=======================

Translation.io (https://translation.io/lingui)
----------------------------------------------

* Documentation: `translation-io <../tools/translation-io.html>`_
* GitHub: `https://github.com/translation/lingui <https://github.com/translation/lingui>`_

Adding a new tool to Lingui
===========================

If you want to integrate a new tool with Lingui, you have to add your
synchronization workflow in a new file located in
`this directory <https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui/tree/main/packages/cli/src/services>`_
and then create a pull request on the main Lingui project.
