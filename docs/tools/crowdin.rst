LinguiJS-based product. Automate localization, release several
multilingual versions of your app simultaneously, and provide an

Features
--------

Keep all translations in one place while connecting your teams via Crowdin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect with your content, marketing, and translation teams in one collaborative space:

- Screenshots for additional context.
- Highlight HTML, placeholders, plurals, and more.
- Describe the context and set character limits to ensure the translation fits the UI.
- All translations are done online or can be uploaded to the platform.
- Jira integration to notify you about source string issues.
- Tips for translators to ensure there is no extra space or broken code.

Ship faster with localization running in parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keep developing new features and improvements while translators receive
new texts in real-time. Release multilingual versions for customers
around the globe simultaneously.

Release your product in several languages at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Help users from different regions use the latest version of your product in their language:

- Get feature branches translated independently from the master branch.
- Translators work together in one place to boost productivity.
- Never deal with translations in spreadsheets or email attachments.
- Source texts are updated for translators automatically and in real-time.
- Automatically pull completed translations that are ready to be merged.

Seamlessly integrate localization during any phase of your development cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automate the integration of source texts and translations between
Crowdin and your source code with one-click integration or customizable
solutions.

Define your translation strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decide who will translate your content:

- Invite your team of translators (in-house translators, freelancers, or translation agencies you already work with).
- Order professional translations from a vendor (translation agency) from Crowdin Vendors Marketplace.
- Configure machine translation engines.
- Engage your community.

VCS: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source strings are pulled automatically and are always up to date for
your translators. Translated content is automatically pushed to your
repository as a request.

Connect cross-platform `Crowdin

repository and never deal with localization files manually again.
