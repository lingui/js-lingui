Lingui is an easy yet powerful internationalization framework for global projects.

- **Clean and readable** - Keep your code clean and readable, while the library uses
  battle-tested and powerful **ICU MessageFormat** under the hood.

- **Universal** - Use it everywhere. `@lingui/core` provides the essential intl
  functionality which works in any JavaScript project while `@lingui/react` offers
  components to leverage React rendering.

- **Full rich-text support** - Use React components inside localized messages
  without any limitation. Writing rich-text messages is as easy as writing JSX.

- **Powerful tooling** - Manage the whole intl workflow using Lingui [CLI][RefCLI]. It
  extracts messages from source code, validates messages coming from translators and
  checks that all messages are translated before shipping to production.

- **Unopinionated** - Integrate Lingui into your existing workflow. It supports
  message keys as well as auto-generated messages. Translations are stored either in
  JSON or standard PO files, which are supported in almost all translation tools.

- **Lightweight and optimized** - Core library is only [1.5 kB gzipped][BundleCore],
  React components are an additional [1.3 kBs gzipped][BundleReact]. That's less than Redux
  for a full-featured intl library.

- **Active community** - Join us on [Discord][Discord] to discuss the latest development.
  At the moment, Lingui is the most active intl project on GitHub.

- **Compatible with react-intl** - Low-level React API is very similar to react-intl
  and the message format is the same. It's easy to migrate an existing project.

## Quickstart

### Install

If you're a react-intl user, check out [a comparison of react-intl and Lingui](https://lingui.dev/misc/react-intl).

## Example

Short example how i18n looks with JSX:

```js
import { Trans } from "@lingui/macro"

function App() {
  return (
   <Trans id="msg.docs" /* id is optional */>
     Read the <a href="https://lingui.dev">documentation</a>
     for more info.
   </Trans>
  )
}
```

Message from this component will be extracted in following format:

```po
msgid "msg.docs"
msgstr "Read the <0>documentation</0> for more info."
```

For more example see the [Examples][Examples] directory.
