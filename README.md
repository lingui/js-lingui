Lingui is an easy yet powerful internationalization framework for global projects.

- **Clean and readable** - Keep your code clean and readable, while the library uses
  battle-tested and powerful **ICU MessageFormat** under the hood.
  
- **Universal** - Use it everywhere. `@lingui/core` provides the essential intl
  functionality which works in any JavaScript project while `@lingui/react` offers
  components to leverage React rendering.

- **Full rich-text support** - Use React components inside localized messages
  without any limitation. Writing rich-text messages is as easy as writing JSX.
  
- **Powerful tooling** - Manage the whole intl workflow using Lingui [CLI][RefCLI]. It
  extracts messages from source code, validates messages coming from translators and
  checks that all messages are translated before shipping to production.
  
- **Unopinionated** - Integrate Lingui into your existing workflow. It supports
  message keys as well as auto generated messages. Translations are stored either in
  JSON or standard PO file, which is supported in almost all translation tools.
  
- **Lightweight and optimized** - Core library is only [1.9 kB gzipped][BundleCore],
  React components are additional [3.1 kBs gzipped][BundleReact]. That's less than Redux
  for a full-featured intl library.
  
- **Active community** - Join us on [Gitter.im][Gitter] to discuss the latest development.
  At the moment, Lingui is the most active intl project on GitHub.
  
- **Compatible with react-intl** - Low-level React API is very similar to react-intl
  and the message format is the same. It's easy to migrate an existing project.
