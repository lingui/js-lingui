### Lingui React Native Demo App

This example app accompanies the tutorial https://lingui.dev/tutorials/react-native.

It can also be used to test out changes made in `@lingui/core` and `@lingui/react`: run `yarn install` in the app directory, and run the app on iOS or Android.
Then modify TS files in `@lingui/core` or `@lingui/react` in the `packages` folder and observe the changes right away.
