Today we are pleased to announce the release of Lingui 6.0! :rocket:

This release focuses primarily on **technical improvements and modernization** of the codebase. It includes the transition to ESM-only distribution, removal of deprecated APIs, and improved TypeScript support. In this post, we'll highlight the key changes in this release.

In line with the principles of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), this release contains **breaking changes** that we have thoroughly documented in the [v6 migration guide](/releases/migration-6).
