# Message Extraction

Message extraction is a key part of the internationalization process. It involves scanning your codebase to identify and extract all the defined messages, ensuring that your message catalogs stay synchronized with the source code.

In practice, developers define messages directly in the source code, and the extraction tool automatically collects these messages and stores them in a message catalog for translation.

Read more about the [`lingui extract`](/docs/ref/cli.md) command.

## Supported Patterns

The extractor operates at a static level, meaning that it analyzes the source code without executing it. As a result, it doesn't support complex patterns or dynamic code, and only simple, statically defined messages are collected.

### Macros Usage

> Macros are JavaScript transformers that run at build time. The value returned by a macro is inlined into the bundle instead of the original function call.

The Lingui Macro provides powerful macros to transform JavaScript objects and JSX elements into [ICU MessageFormat](/docs/guides/message-format.md) messages at compile time.

Extractor supports all macro usage, such as the following examples:

```tsx
import { t } from "@lingui/core/macro";
import { Trans } from "@lingui/react/macro";

t`Message`;

t({
  id: "custom.id",
  message: "Message with custom ID",
});

const jsx = <Trans>Hi, my name is {name}</Trans>;
```

The extractor matches the `t` and `Trans` macro calls and extracts the messages from them.

For more usage examples, see to the [Macros](/docs/ref/macro.mdx) reference.

### Non-Macros Usage

Non-macro use is also supported, but it's not common. It's recommended to use macros.

The extractor matches `i18n._` or `i18n.t` function calls. It also matches when these functions are called from other member expressions, such as `ctx.i18n.t()`.

:::caution
The extractor only matches calls by name. It doesn't check if they are really imported from Lingui packages.
:::

For example:

```ts
i18n._("message.id");
i18n._({ id: "message.id" });

ctx.i18n._("message.id");
ctx.i18n.t("message.id");

ctx.request.i18n.t("message.id");

// and so on
```

To ignore a specific call expression during extraction, you can add a `lingui-extract-ignore` comment:

```ts
/* lingui-extract-ignore */
ctx.i18n._("Message");
```

Messages marked with this comment will be excluded from extraction.

### Explicitly Marking Messages

In addition to call expressions, which are the most commonly used method, the extractor tool also supports simple string literals and message descriptors with explicit annotations.

To do this, simply prefix your expression with the `/*i18n*/` comment, like so:

```ts
const messageDescriptor: MessageDescriptor = /*i18n*/ { id: "Description", comment: "description" };
const stringLiteral = /*i18n*/ "Message";
```

## Unsupported Patterns

The extractor is limited to extracting messages from code that is written a certain way. It cannot extract messages from variables or function calls. It also cannot follow the program structure and get the value of a variable defined elsewhere.

This means that in order for a message to be extracted, it must be defined directly in the function call:

```ts
// ❌ This message will not be extracted
const message = "Message";
i18n._(message);

// ✅ This message will be extracted
i18n._("Message");
```

## Defining Sources for Analyzing

The extractor can locate source files in two ways: by specifying a glob pattern or by crawling the dependency tree.

### Glob Pattern

By default, `lingui extract` uses a glob pattern to search for source files containing messages.

The pattern is defined in the [`catalogs`](/docs//ref/conf.md#catalogs) property of the Lingui configuration file in your project's root directory.

### Dependency Tree Crawling

While the glob-based extraction process works well for most projects, it can be challenging for multi-page applications (MPAs) such as Next.js. In such cases, the glob approach generates a single catalog that includes all messages from each page, which may not be ideal for effectively managing translations.

This means that the entire catalog must be loaded for each page or navigation, resulting in unnecessary loading of messages that aren't utilized on that specific page.

To address this issue, an `experimental-extractor` has been introduced in Lingui v4.

:::caution Experimental
This is an experimental feature. Experimental features are not covered by semver and may be subject to change.
:::

This extractor uses the dependency tree of files, rather than just a glob pattern, to crawl imports and discover files more accurately.

By doing so, it creates a more optimized catalog that only contains the messages needed for each page.

The catalogs would still contain duplicate messages for common components, but it would be much better than the current approach.

![Scheme of discovering by dependencies](/img/docs/extractor-deps-scheme.jpg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Scheme of discovering by dependencies](/img/docs/extractor-deps-scheme-dark.jpg#gh-dark-mode-only)

To start using `experimental-extractor`, add the following section to your Lingui configuration:

```ts
/**
 *
 * @type {import('@lingui/conf').LinguiConfig}
 */
module.exports = {
  // remove everethying from `catalogs` property
  catalogs: [],
  // highlight-start
  experimental: {
    extractor: {
      // glob pattern of entrypoints
      // this will find all nextjs pages
      entries: ["<rootDir>/src/pages/**/*.tsx"],
      // output pattern, this instruct extractor where to store catalogs
      // src/pages/faq.tsx -> src/pages/locales/faq/en.po
      output: "<rootDir>/{entryDir}/locales/{entryName}/{locale}",
    },
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

Then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
lingui extract-experimental
```

#### Important Notes

It's worth noting that the accuracy of the catalog depends heavily on tree-shaking, a technique used by modern bundlers to remove unused code from the final bundle.

If the code passed to the extractor is written in a tree-shakeable way, the user will get highly accurate catalogs.

While you may think that your code is tree-shakeable, in practice tree-shaking may work differently than you expect, and some unwanted strings may be included in the catalogs.

To illustrate, let's consider the following code:

```ts
import { msg } from "@lingui/core/macro";

export const species = {
  Cardano: [
    {
      startsAt: 0,
      name: msg`Ghost`,
      icon: "Ghost",
    },
    {
      startsAt: 0.000001,
      name: msg`Plankton`,
      icon: "Plankton",
    },
  ],
};
```

On the surface, it may appear that this code can be safely removed from the final bundle if it isn't used. However, the `msg` function call may have a side effect that prevents the bundler from removing the entire `species` object from the final bundle. As a result, messages defined in this snippet may be included in more catalogs than expected.

:::tip
To avoid this issue, one solution is to wrap the `species` object inside an _Immediately Invoked Function Expression_ (IIFE) and add the `/* @__PURE__ */` annotation.
:::

By adding this annotation to the IIFE, we tell the bundler that the entire `species` object can be safely removed if it is not used or exported elsewhere in the code.

## Supported Source Types

The extractor supports TypeScript, Flow, and JavaScript (Stage 3) out of the box.

If you are using some experimental features (Stage 0 - Stage 2) or frameworks with custom syntax such as Vue.js or Svelte, you may want to implement your own custom extractor.
