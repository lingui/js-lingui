# Dynamic Loading of Message Catalogs

Internationalization in modern applications requires an efficient way to manage and load localized messages without overwhelming the initial bundle size. With Lingui's flexible approach, the developer is responsible for dynamically loading message catalogs based on the active language.

The [`I18nProvider`](/docs/ref/react.md#i18nprovider) component doesn't make assumptions about your app's structure, giving you the freedom to load only the necessary messages for the currently selected language.

This guide shows how to set up dynamic loading of message catalogs, ensuring only the needed catalogs are loaded, which reduces bundle size and improves performance.

## Final i18n Loader Helper

The following code defines the complete logic for dynamically loading and activating message catalogs based on the selected locale. It ensures that only the required catalog is loaded at runtime, optimizing performance:

```tsx title="i18n.ts"
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";

export const locales = {
  en: "English",
  cs: "ÄŒesky",
};
export const defaultLocale = "en";

/**
 * We do a dynamic import of just the catalog that we need
 * @param locale any locale string
 */
export async function dynamicActivate(locale: string) {
  const { messages } = await import(`./locales/${locale}/messages`);
  i18n.load(locale, messages);
  i18n.activate(locale);
}
```

### Usage in Your Application

To use the `dynamicActivate` function in your application, you must call it on application startup. The following example shows how to use it in a React application:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import App from "./App";

import { I18nProvider } from "@lingui/react";
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";
import { defaultLocale, dynamicActivate } from "./i18n";

const I18nApp = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // With this method we dynamically load the catalogs
    dynamicActivate(defaultLocale);
  }, []);

  return (
    <I18nProvider i18n={i18n}>
      <App />
    </I18nProvider>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

Looking at the content of build dir, we see one chunk per language:

```bash
i18n-0.c433b3bd.chunk.js
i18n-1.f0cf2e3d.chunk.js
main.ab4626ef.js
```

When the page is first loaded, only the main bundle and the bundle for the first language are loaded:

After changing the language in the UI, the second language bundle is loaded:
