# JavaScript Apps Internationalization

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use Lingui's internationalization features that don't depend on React. We'll take a minimalist approach and cover the main features of the `@lingui/core` package.

## Installing Lingui

1. Follow the [Installation and Setup](/docs/installation.mdx) page for initial setup.
2. Install the [`@lingui/core`](/docs/ref/core.md) package, which is responsible for translation and handling of message catalogs.

## Setting up i18n

First we need to setup the i18n singleton, which is pretty simple:

```js
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";

// messages.js is generated by the cli
import { messages } from "path-to-locale/en/messages.js";

i18n.load("en", messages);
i18n.activate("en");
```

## Localizing Your App

Once that is done, we can go ahead and use it! Wrap your text in [`t`](/docs/ref/macro.mdx#t) macro:

```js
import { t } from "@lingui/core/macro";

t`Hello World!`;
// becomes "Salut le monde!"

const name = "Fred";
t`My name is ${name}`;
// becomes "Je m'appelle Fred"
```

Plurals and selections are possible using plural and select methods:

```js
import { plural } from "@lingui/core/macro";

const count = 42;

plural(count, {
  one: "# book",
  other: "# books",
});
// becomes "42 livres"
```

It's also possible to nest message formats. Each message format method in i18n has a standalone companion, which only returns message without performing the translation:

```js
import { t, select, plural } from "@lingui/core/macro"

select(gender, {
  offset: 1,
  female: plural(numOfGuests, {
    offset: 1,
    0: t`${host} does not give a party.`,
    1: t`${host} invites ${guest} to her party.`,
    2: t`${host} invites ${guest} and one other person to her party.`,
    other: t`${host} invites ${guest} and # other people to her party.`
  }),
  male: plural(value, {...}),
  other: plural(value, {...}),
})
```
