# JavaScript Apps Internationalization

This tutorial will walk you through using Lingui's internationalization (i18n) features in a vanilla JavaScript application. We'll cover the essentials of the `@lingui/core` package, which handles all translation and message catalog management.

:::tip Example
If you're looking for a working solution, check out the [Vanilla JS example](https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui/tree/main/examples/js). This example application shows a complete setup using Lingui and vanilla JavaScript.
:::

## Installing Lingui

1. Follow the [Installation and Setup](/docs/installation.mdx) page for initial setup.
2. Install the [`@lingui/core`](/docs/ref/core.md) package, which is responsible for translation and message catalog handling.

## Setting up i18n

First, we need to set up the i18n singleton, which is pretty simple:

```js
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";
import { messages } from "path-to-locale/en/messages.js";

i18n.load("en", messages);
i18n.activate("en");
```

The `messages.js` is generated by the Lingui CLI and contains compiled message catalogs.

:::tip
Alternatively, you can load catalogs dynamically using the [`@lingui/loader`](/docs/ref/loader.md) or [`@lingui/vite-plugin`](/docs/ref/vite-plugin.md) without the need to import compiled messages manually.

## Localizing Your App

To localize your application, you need to wrap your localizable texts in [Macros](/docs/ref/macro.mdx). Lingui provides a set of Core Macros that transform tagged template literals and can be used in any JavaScript context.

Let's wrap our text in the [`t`](/docs/ref/macro.mdx#t) macro:

```js
import { t } from "@lingui/core/macro";

t`Hello World!`;
// becomes "Salut le monde!"

const name = "Fred";
t`My name is ${name}`;
// becomes "Je m'appelle Fred"
```

Plurals and selections are possible using [`plural`](/docs/ref/macro.mdx#plural) and [`select`](/docs/ref/macro.mdx#select) macros:

```js
import { plural } from "@lingui/core/macro";

const count = 42;

plural(count, {
  one: "# book",
  other: "# books",
});
// becomes "42 livres"
```

It's also possible to nest message formats. Each message format method in `i18n` has a standalone companion, which only returns message without performing the translation:

```js
import { t, select, plural } from "@lingui/core/macro";

select(gender, {
  offset: 1,
  female: plural(numOfGuests, {
    offset: 1,
    0: t`${host} does not give a party.`,
    1: t`${host} invites ${guest} to her party.`,
    2: t`${host} invites ${guest} and one other person to her party.`,
    other: t`${host} invites ${guest} and # other people to her party.`
  }),
  male: plural(value, {...}),
  other: plural(value, {...}),
});
```
