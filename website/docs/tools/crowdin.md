## Features

### Keep all translations in one place while connecting your teams via Crowdin

Connect with your content, marketing, and translation teams in one collaborative space:

- Screenshots for additional context.
- Highlight HTML, placeholders, plurals, and more.
- Describe the context and set character limits to ensure the translation fits the UI.
- All translations are done online or can be uploaded to the platform.
- Jira integration to notify you about source string issues.
- Tips for translators to ensure there is no extra space or broken code.

### Ship faster with localization running in parallel

Keep developing new features and improvements while translators receive new texts in real-time. Release multilingual versions for customers around the globe simultaneously.

### Release your product in several languages at once

Help users from different regions use the latest version of your product in their language:

- Get feature branches translated independently from the master branch.
- Translators work together in one place to boost productivity.
- Never deal with translations in spreadsheets or email attachments.
- Source texts are updated for translators automatically and in real-time.
- Automatically pull completed translations that are ready to be merged.

### Seamlessly integrate localization during any phase of your development cycle

Automate the integration of source texts and translations between Crowdin and your source code with one-click integration or customizable solutions.

### Define your translation strategy

Decide who will translate your content:

- Invite your team of translators (in-house translators, freelancers, or translation agencies you already work with).
- Order professional translations from a vendor (translation agency) from Crowdin Vendors Marketplace.
- Configure machine translation engines.
- Engage your community.

### VCS: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

Source strings are pulled automatically and are always up to date for your translators. Translated content is automatically pushed to your repository as a request.

### CLI

Easily integrate Crowdin with your CI server, GIT, SVN, Mercurial, etc. Connect cross-platform [Crowdin CLI](https://developer.crowdin.com/cli-tool/?utm_source=lingui.dev&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lingui.dev) directly to your code repository and never deal with localization files manually again.
